Code for implimenting cieser cipher.
Cieser cipher is an classical cryptographic method
It shifts the letters in the word according to the key given
for example if key = 3, letter is 'A' then it shift it to 'D'
similarly for 'Z' it is 'C'
this creates an unreadable text called - cipher text
same key is used for decryption of the cipher text which performs shift in reverse way
resulting in the actual word or letter.
